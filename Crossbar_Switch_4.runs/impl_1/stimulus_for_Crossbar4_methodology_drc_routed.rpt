2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.006 ns between req_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk) and req[1] (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.024 ns between req_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk) and req[0] (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.062 ns between req_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk) and req[3] (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.068 ns between req_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk) and req[2] (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 1.000 ns has been defined on port 'hard_reset' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_input_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -min 1.000 [get_ports hard_reset]
D:/HDL/Crossbar4/Crossbar4.srcs/constrs_1/imports/digilent-xdc-master/Arty-A7-35-Master.xdc (Line: 17)
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 1.000 ns has been defined on port 'req[0]' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -min 1.000 [get_ports req]

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#3 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 1.000 ns has been defined on port 'req[1]' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -min 1.000 [get_ports req]

XDCH-2#4 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 1.000 ns has been defined on port 'req[2]' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -min 1.000 [get_ports req]

XDCH-2#5 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 1.000 ns has been defined on port 'req[3]' relative to clock clk for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks clk] -min 1.000 [get_ports req]
